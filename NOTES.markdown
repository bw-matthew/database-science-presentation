Why Use Tools
-------------

Choosing the features to investigate involves using judgement.
As a programmer you are paid to use your judgement every day.
So you should be able to use your judgement to determine which features are valuable.

What if your judgement is wrong?
What if other features are more illuminating?
Cognitive bias is a consistent skew on judgement.

The Paul process of data science establishes a good environment for cognitive bias.
You establish what you want to determine and then investigate the data.
You are likely to choose features which you mentally associate with the goal.

Marketing has become more data driven.
Should feature selection be more data driven?
